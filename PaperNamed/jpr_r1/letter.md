Dear Editors of the Journal of Peace Research,

thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit my manuscript "Two Sword Lengths Apart: Credible Commitment Problems and Physical Violence in Multi-party Elected National Legislatures
".

I have done my best to incorporate the reviewers' very helpful suggestions, as well as your own while keeping the manuscript within the Journal's word limit. (The revised text's word count is [GET].)

I have highlighted key changes in the text with track changes and notes. My detailed responses to the suggestions are below.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require more information or have other suggestions.

P.S. The footnote numbering will automatically return to normal when we remove the track changes. This is simply an artifact of the LaTeX track changes package we used.

# Editor

> Avoid the use of the term ‘recently’ in the abstract.

    - Removed.

> Explain ‘disproportionate electoral outcomes’ in the abstract and earlier in the introduction.

    - I added a straighforward explanation of disproportionate electoral outcomes in the abstract and introduction.

> P. 1: ‘Actual, sword fights…’ -> ‘Actual sword fights…’

    - Corrected.

> P. 2 and elsewhere: ‘paper’ -> ‘article’.

    - Replace all 'paper' with 'article'.

> P. 4: ‘a large increases’ -> ‘a large increase’

    - Corrected.

> P 5 and 7: please name hypotheses ‘H1’ and ‘H2’.

> P. 6: ‘(Saideman, Lanoue and Stanton, 2002, 108)’ -> ‘(Saideman, Lanoue & Stanton, 2002: 108)’, here and throughout the ms.

> P. 7: ‘(see Lijphart, 2007)’ -> ‘(Lijphart, 2007)’, here and throughout the ms.  

    - Removed 'see' from all in-text citations.

> P. 12: footnote 1 close to the bottom: which note does this refer to?

    - Very sorry, this footnote should have been for a description of the search terms/data gathering process. This was mistakenly left out of the original submission due to a LaTeX issues. I have reentered it (see below).

> P. 13: please name all six countries making up 60% of events.

    - I have completed the full list of eight countries with 4 or more incidents making up about 55% of cases in the updated data set.  

> P. 18: Models A4..A8 are, in my view superfluous and can be moved to the online appendix and mentioned only briefly in a footnote.

    - I have moved these models to the Appendix (Table [GET]).

    - I also moved the discussion of the variables in these models to the Appendix.

> P. 18: please consider adding past armed conflict as a control.

    - Thank you for this useful suggestion. Its inclusion has revealed interesting results.

    I estimated the effect of internal armed conflicts in the regression tables. (The results from all conflicts are similar, as there are very few interstate conflicts in the sample period.) The data is from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. The variable is strongly positively associated with legislative violence in almost all models. The inclusion of the variable does not substantively alter the core original findings.

    I have added the variable to the regression estimates tables and included a discussion on page [GET].  [WRITE UP]

> Since one of the key contributions is the dataset, please do provide additional information on the data collection procedure (e.g. search algorithm?) and the coding (e.g. how did you separate between multiple events involving the same actors). Additional information should be included in the article, though more detailed descriptions may be relegated to the supplementary (online) file.

    - I realise that unfortunately the footnote detailing the original data gathering process was accidentally not included in the original version. I have made sure that this is now in the paper. In addition, I and two new research assistants have verified and updated the data set using additional Google and Youtube (a surprisingly good source of information on legislative brawls) keyword searches. I have added a description of this process to the paper. [GET NUMBER]

    - Regarding multiple events involving the same actors: by viewing Youtube video footage of many of the brawls, it is clear that each brawl can be considered a single event. Though brawl intensity varies over the course of the brawl as more or fewer legislators are involved, they tend to center around the same issue on the same day. Therefore I treat each brawl as a single event per day. I added a footnote on this to [GET PAGE]. [THINK ABOUT]

    - In addition, I added to the Supplementary Materials a discussion of why the higher number of observed violent incidents later in the sample is likely largely the result of an increase in new democracies during that period rather than measurement error. [GET PAGE]

# Reviewer 2



> 3. Relatedly, I wonder whether this piece can actually say something about the timing of political violence. As it stands, democracy age and proportionality are relatively static, at least within a legislative session. Yet, the case study shows that it is the exogenous shocks that interact with the institutions to determine political violence; “three shocks that were largely exogenous from the national legislature” (page 10). It is my reading that the model does a good job of explaining the baseline level (or average) of political violence in a country, but a poor job of explaining why political violence occurs over time. Explaining how societal influences change in the context of legislative procedures would produce a dynamic account of legislative violence. You get at this partially by including measures of exogenous shocks like GINI and ethnic fractionalization, but these are included additively rather than interactively.

    - This is a very interesting idea. Societal factors, however, such as demographics of inequality and ethnicity do not have straightforward effects on legislative institutions. [FINISH]

    TIME SCALE data is too short to examine this. For example, in the US case the changes leading up to legislative violence occurred over about 50 years.

    In the Supplementary materials I include regressions interacting societal factors with key legislative institutional factors. The results are not suggestive of such effects. [TO-DO]

    Because of this, it would be very difficult to pursue this line of research within a quantitative framework. Instead, like the case study presented in the paper,  

    I think examining how countries' legislative institutions respond to demographic shifts is an interesting, but highly complex issue that is better suited for a larger research project. This work would then clearly inform the study of legislative violence over longer periods of time.


> 4. I appreciate the empirical check for possible bias by limiting the sample to after 1990. However, I think more is needed to convince the reader that your method of data collection (assembling based on the Google News Archive) is picking up the universe of cases (or is in fact the best option available). Since some of the value of this project is in the creation of the original data set on legislative violence, it would be useful to describe this data collection in more detail. The fact that the author removes 22% of the sample by excluding the two most recent years (2010-2011) suggests that there is a bias for later years.

    - First, I discovered that a footnote detailing the search keywords that I used did not show up in the original submitted version. I have re-added this [PAGE NUMBER].

    - Second, I and two research assistants have conducted additional searches with Google and Youtube (a surprisingly good source of videos of brawls) since the original data collection. This allows me to include observations through 2012 and improved our confidence that we have found close to the universe of incidents within our sampling frame.

    - Third, I agree that there is a bias in the later years. This is a problem with virtually all digitally available data. However, perhaps the only other improvement on gathering this data would be to examine every country's legislatures printed record. This would be a considerable undertaking often involving accessing physical archives in well over 100 countries and many languages. This would be unfeasible without considerable funding.

    - Fourth, legislative records may in some regards be an inferior source. Brawls tend to be heavily reported on by the media. However, they are in many ways outside of normal legislative business and so many not actually be officially recorded.


    + Given these extensive efforts to capture all incidents of legislative violence over approximately the past quarter century there are still more observed incidents in the recent past than in the 1980s and 1990s. There are at least two possible reasons for this:

        - Measurement error: more information is available online for more recent incidents.

        - Democratization: the number of countries with elected legislatures has increased markedly over the observation period. In 1981 there were only 65 countries with elected legislatures in the sample. By 1990 there were 80. By 2012--the last year in the updated sample--there were 149. The shift to democratization actually corresponds to the number of violent incidents observed in the sample. In a new section in the Supplementary Materials [GET PAGE NUMBER] I plot the number of countries with elected multi-party legislatures in the sample per year and compare this to a plot of observed violent incidents per year. We can clearly see that there are on average many fewer incidents of violence in the period prior to about 1995 when there were also relatively few democracies. Raw incidents of violence have increased as the number of countries with elected legislatures has increased. In addition, there are many more new democracies, which as we found in the paper's empirics tend to have more violence.

    In sum, while measurement error may still be a problem despite extensive efforts to find all incidents of legislative violence, the fact that there are more incidents later in the sampling period could largely be the result of there simply being more new democracies.


> 5. I think that the empirics are competent done and I appreciate the extent of the robustness checks. My concern is that there is not enough variation in the dependent variable (especially by limiting the sample to smaller time periods), which is causing some of the “very large, highly unstable, and largely nonsenical coefficient estimates” (page 17). What can the author do to assuage these fears?

    - In addition to the rare events logistic regression method that corrects bias created using a small number of 1's relative to 0's, it is important to note that the "very large, highly unstable, and largely nonsenical coefficient estimates" were only estimated for a small number of variables: political system type and components of the self-expression variable, neither of which are strongly theoretically related to legislative violence. The instability in the coefficient estimates likely has more to do with a lack of variation/large missingness on these variables rather than the violence dependent variable. Political system rarely changes in the sample and missingness in the World Values survey data more than halves the sample size due to list wise deletion. The fact that variables that have better coverage/more variation produce consistently stable coefficients bolsters the case that this is an issue with a small set of independent variables, rather than the dependent variable.

    + A related issue: is important to note that I have taken extensive additional steps to ensure that the data set includes all of the incidents of legislative violence in the sampling period. Since submitting the manuscript, I and other research assistants undertook a new effort to verify and update the data set. We have conducted further keyword searches on Google and Youtube (an excellent source of detailed video evidence of legislative brawls). We did this for both the original submission's time period as well as to the present. As such, we are confident that we have found close to all of the incidents in the sampling period.


> 6. One last nit-picky comment. I like the figures, but the use of jittered dots (rather than confidence intervals or some other alternative) needlessly increases the file size and caused my printer to choke!

    - The plot now uses point rangers/ribbons to show the expected probabilities. This dramatically decreases the file size and increases legibility.


# Reviewer 3

> My first issue with the manuscript comes from the seemingly normative view that violence in the legislature is an indication of poor functioning. . . While I generally agree with the author(s) intuition that we generally do not want violence in these bodies, I would also be careful about attributing that as a sign of good or bad governance. I suspect that we could easily come up with numerous examples where violence was needed to accomplish outcomes. . .  violence in the international system is argued as simply being another type of bargaining behavior and not as some sign of a poorly functioning system. Why could violence at the domestic level be seen in a similar light as simply continuing the bargaining process in a different manner?

    - In many ways I whole heartedly agree with you that a lack of violence does not necessarily indicate that well functioning democratic institutions. No violence in an autocratic legislature, for example, certainly doesn't indicate that the body is a well functioning democratic institution.

    I've tried to highlight in the theory section that legislative violence certainly is a continuation of 'the bargaining process in a different manner'. This is a direct implication of using credible commitment theory to understand legislative violence. [TO-DO] I have also added a discussion to the Conclusion highlighting the point that a lack of violence does not necessarily mean that a legislature is a well-functioning democratic institution.

    Furthermore, the manuscript discusses this possibility in the subsection on the size of the governing majority--a lack of violence in large governing majority legislatures may be both an indication that many legislators are included in the legislative process and can effectively bargain peacefully *or* that the governing majority is so powerful that it can take actions to quash violence before it happens.

    Perhaps the one (purely normative) point of disagreement that I have is that, while a lack of violence may not indicate well-functioning democratic institutions, a presence of violence *does* indicate that these institutions are not functioning according to the democratic ideal of enabling peaceful political contestation .

    Attempts to structure political institutions such that bargaining and contestation can be effectively conducted in a peaceful manner is a foundational goal of much of the political science literature in this area.

    In sum, the paper has two purposes:

        + The proximal/empirical purpose: understand the conditions under which legislative bargaining reaches a point where one or more parties feel that violence is a useful tactic.

        + The distal/normative purpose: highlight which of these findings could inform democratic institutional designs such that peaceful bargaining and competition between legislators will be more likely.




> 8. Finally, with so many zero cases and an event count, why not use a zero inflated negative binomial model?

    - I examined the possibility of using zero inflated negative binomial regression. This was not in practice possible (using zeroinfl from the R pscl package). There are few country-years with more than 1 brawl (32). Most of these had two brawls, only 6 had 3 brawls. As zero inflated negative binomial regression uses a mixture model, there are likely not enough variation in the count part of the model to estimate it. Furthermore, while I have strong hypotheses regarding whether or not violence will occure (i.e. the logistic part of the mixture model), I don't have any strong priors about why a country would have 2 as opposed to 1 brawl. As such, though this was a helpful possibility to explore zero inflated negative binomial regression appears to neither be estimable for this data or theoretically justified.  [THINK ABOUT]
