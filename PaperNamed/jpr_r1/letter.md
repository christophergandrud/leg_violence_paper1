Dear Editors of the Journal of Peace Research,

thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit my manuscript "Two Sword Lengths Apart: Credible Commitment Problems and Physical Violence in Multi-party Elected National Legislatures
".

I have done my best to incorporate the reviewers' very helpful suggestions, as well as your own while keeping the manuscript within the Journal's 10,000 word limit. (The revised text's word count is [GET].) The manuscript is much improved for them.

I have highlighted key changes in the text with track changes and notes. My detailed responses to the suggestions are below.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require more information or have other suggestions.

P.S. The footnote numbering will automatically return to normal when we remove the track changes. This is simply an artifact of the LaTeX track changes package we used.

> P. 18: please consider adding past armed conflict as a control.

    - Thank you for this useful suggestion. Its inclusion has revealed interesting results.

    I estimated the effect of internal armed conflicts in the regression tables. (The results from all conflicts are similar, as there are very few interstate conflicts in the sample period.) The data is from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. Overall the variable is not robustly significant and does not alter the central findings.

    I have added the variable to the regression estimates tables.

> Since one of the key contributions is the dataset, please do provide additional information on the data collection procedure (e.g. search algorithm?) and the coding (e.g. how did you separate between multiple events involving the same actors). Additional information should be included in the article, though more detailed descriptions may be relegated to the supplementary (online) file.

    - I realise that unfortunately the footnote detailing the original data gathering process was accidentally not included in the original version. I have made sure that this is now in the paper. In addition, I and two new research assistants have verified and updated the data set using additional LexisNexis, NewsLibrary, NewsBank, NewsBank, Google, and Youtube (a surprisingly good source of information on legislative brawls) keyword searches. I have added a description of this process to the paper. [GET NUMBER]

    - Regarding multiple events involving the same actors: by viewing Youtube video footage of many of the brawls, it is clear that each brawl can be considered a single event. Though brawl intensity varies over the course of the brawl as more or fewer legislators are involved, they tend to center around the same issue on the same day. Therefore I treat each brawl as a single event per day. I added a footnote on this to [GET PAGE]. [THINK ABOUT]

    - In addition, I added to the Supplementary Materials a discussion of why the higher number of observed violent incidents later in the sample is likely largely the result of an increase in new democracies during that period rather than measurement error. [GET PAGE]

# Joint concerns

Both Reviewer 2 and 3 wonder whether legislators are concerned about legislative procedures or policy outcomes when deciding whether to brawl. Reviewer 2 mentions: " I wonder ... whether these are separate influences on the credible commitment mechanism (control of policy versus ability to alter the procedures), or whether they moderate the influence of the other". Reviewer 3 asks: "why are we assuming that legislatures are looking at the distribution of legislative resources and not legislative outcomes or even political outcomes?"


    My summary response: Overall, the theoretical focus of this paper is on the control of legislative resources, broadly defined and as such largely encompassing both control of policy and control of legislative rules. This is reasonable as control over legislative procedures and control over legislative policy outcomes are very similar. To clarify this point I have altered the wording in the paper [TO-DO] to show that credible commitment problems are typically related to both. Who controls the procedures often controls the policy outcomes. And policy outcomes can affect who controls the procedures in the future.

    That being said, I have tried to control for how easy it is to change policy outcomes (not simply legislative outcomes) by adding in Henisz's Political Constraints variable. In additive models, this was not significant. There is (weak) evidence that perhaps credible commitment problems can be lessened in new democracies when it is harder to change policy.


    Explanation of the entanglement of control of legislative procedures/control of policy outcomes: I would argue, based on the prevailing understanding in legislative studies--in particular Cox's  'legislative cartel'--that these are highly intertwined such that who controls the legislative procedures controls what bills pass the legislature. Cox showed, for example, how important control of the legislative session's agenda was to affecting what bills pass. As such legislators, even those primarily concerned with policy outcomes, will be highly influenced in their behaviour by credible commitments about legislative rules and use of legislative resources.

    It becomes even more difficult to separate the two given that policy outcomes, not directly related to legislative procedures can affect future distributions of legislative procedural power. For example, a recent brawl in South Korea was over media ownership rights. Allowing greater consolidation of media ownership, many feared would politically advantage the main right-wing governing party. The US case study in the article is another case in point. An end to slavery and the introduction of voting rights for African Americans would effectively end slave owning politicians' legislative power in the future.  

    That being said, control over what passes in the legislature is not necessarily the same thing as who controls policy outcomes, especially if there are external veto players (e.g. presidents or judiciaries). To operationalise how difficult it is to change policy I included Henisz's widely used measure of political constraints, which explicitly captures the feasibility of policy change. In purely additive models it is not statistically significant, i.e. I did not find evidence that there is an addittive relationship between political constraints and legislative brawls. In a new Interactions section in the Supplemental Materials (page [GET]) I discuss some evidence that perhaps there is an interaction between political constraints and democratic age, such that more political constraints could help overcome credible commitment problems in new democracies. Current losers may be less worried that the current winners can change the rules/implement policies that shift or entrench power in their favour.

# Reviewer 2

> The two theoretical variables (age of democracy and proportionality) seem to be focused on explaining the credible mechanism related to control of the rules rather than altering the legislative procedures

    - I have a question regarding this statement: how do we distinguish between "control of the rules" and "altering legislative procedures"? To a large extent these seem to me to be equivalent. It would be very helpful if the reviewer could elaborate on this point.


> 2. Proportionality and democratic age are not themselves the cause of political violence, but are instead merely proxies for what is going on in the society as a whole, or as the author puts it, “large rapid demographic and party system shifts” (page 6). This might be the reason why a measure of societal differences (ethnic fractionalization) is significant in some of the models (as noted on page 20).

    - The large-n empirical results do not really support this interpretation. As mentioned in the paper ([GET PAGE]), the expectation would be that the societal variables would at least be associated with violence in models without the proportionality/democratic age variables if they were the underlying cause of violence. This is not the case.

    A new section/table added to the Supplemental Materials shows and discusses models that have ethnic fractionalisation and other key variables list-wise added. In a model by itself, the variable is highly statistically insignificant. Estimates where ethnic fractionalization is statistically significant (at the 10% level) are highly model dependent Not only are they not found in models with only ethnic fractionalization but also when proportionality is included.  

    Furthermore, the coefficient estimate, regardless of level of statistical significance, are negative. I.e. more fractionalization is associated with less violence. This is strongly counter to expectations. (Though I hazard to explain the direction of a non-statistically significant coefficient estimate, my guess would be that countries with high ethnic homogeneity--e.g. South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan--could be driving this result.) Given that the estimates are (a) not found in models without the disproportionality finding, (b) weakly statistically significant results are highly model dependent, and (c) run counter to expectations it is reasonable to conclude that this paper has found no evidence that age of democracy and proportionality are merely proxies for ethnic fractionalisation when it comes to causing legislative violence.

    There are two further points to make when thinking this issue:

    - First, despite these null findings, perhaps societal factors cause changes in proportionality and democratic regime age.

    - Second, maybe societal factors interact with democratic age/proportionality to affect outcomes.

    On the first point, this is surely going on to some extent, e.g.: Society causes -> Dem age/proportionality causes -> credible commitment problems -> legislative violence. This is a very interesting issue and surely occurs as is demonstrated in the US case study. However, as with most investigations of societal phenomenon we need to distinguish between distal (in this case societal factors and other things such as factor endowments in the US case study) and proximal causes. This paper is primarily about proximal causes. A full investigation of theGiven this, such an investigation of the multi-step causal chain it is infeasible to investigate thoroughly in this single article. Nonetheless, the US case study makes an important initial contribution to this work. complex interactive relationships between the distal causes that create the proximal causes is beyond the scope of this work.

    Additionally, as discussed more below, these societal factors often change very slowly, especially relative to the length of the sample available.

    See below for a discussion of the second possibility.

> 3. Relatedly, I wonder whether this piece can actually say something about the timing of political violence. As it stands, democracy age and proportionality are relatively static, at least within a legislative session. Yet, the case study shows that it is the exogenous shocks that interact with the institutions to determine political violence; “three shocks that were largely exogenous from the national legislature” (page 10). It is my reading that the model does a good job of explaining the baseline level (or average) of political violence in a country, but a poor job of explaining why political violence occurs over time. Explaining how societal influences change in the context of legislative procedures would produce a dynamic account of legislative violence. You get at this partially by including measures of exogenous shocks like GINI and ethnic fractionalization, but these are included additively rather than interactively.

    - This is a very interesting idea. In the Supplementary Materials [GET PAGES] I have included estimates from models that interact the two key political variables with societal factors and political constraints. There is some evidence that ethnic fractionalization and a lack of political constraints heightened credible commitment problems in very new democracies. I briefly mention these findings in the main text as well, but do not include them because the substantive significance, given considerable overlap in expected values, is relatively weak. I would happy to move these findings to the main text if you feel this is crucial.

    - I think it is important to note that it is probably incorrect to consider the disproportionality and age of democracy variables as static relative to societal factors, especially over the period for which I have large-n data. Democratic age changes every year. Legislative majorities and proportionality changes at each election and can change dramatically from election to election given relatively simple electoral rule changes.

    Societal factors such as ethnic fractionalization, income inequality, and societal attitudes, on the other hand, typically change very slowly over 25 or so year periods. The processes behind ethnic and cultural shifts can take generations. The shocks that led to increasing disproportionality in the US case study, for example, materialised over almost half a century, even in a rapidly changing country with very high immigration and territorial expansion that is unparalleled in recent times. Societal factors change so slowly that much of the data on them is updated infrequently. The most extreme case is Alesina et al.'s (2003) heavily used data(there are 71 Google Scholar citations of it from 2015 alone as of March 2015). It is in fact completely static over the sample period.


    Because of this, it would be very difficult to examine in a quantitative framework how *changes* in ethnic fractionalisation, etc *change* credible commitment problems over longer periods of time. As a viable alternative in future work before a much longer-time series is available, case study work, like the case study presented in the paper, could explore how societal changes could affect political institutions and credible commitment problems.

> 4. I appreciate the empirical check for possible bias by limiting the sample to after 1990. However, I think more is needed to convince the reader that your method of data collection (assembling based on the Google News Archive) is picking up the universe of cases (or is in fact the best option available). Since some of the value of this project is in the creation of the original data set on legislative violence, it would be useful to describe this data collection in more detail. The fact that the author removes 22% of the sample by excluding the two most recent years (2010-2011) suggests that there is a bias for later years.

    - First, I discovered that a footnote detailing the search keywords that I used did not show up in the original submitted version. I have re-added this [PAGE NUMBER].

    - Second, I and two research assistants have conducted additional searches with LexisNexis, NewsLibrary, NewsBank, Google and Youtube (a surprisingly good source of videos of brawls) since the original data collection. This allows me to include observations through 2012 and improved our confidence that we have found close to the universe of incidents within our sampling frame.

    - Third, I agree that there is a bias in the later years. This is a problem with virtually all digitally available data. However, perhaps the only other improvement on gathering this data would be to examine every country's legislatures printed record. This would be a considerable undertaking often involving accessing physical archives in well over 100 countries and many languages. This would be unfeasible without considerable funding.

    - Fourth, legislative records may in some regards be an inferior source. Brawls tend to be heavily reported on by the media. However, they are in many ways outside of normal legislative business and so many not actually be officially recorded.

    + Given these extensive efforts to capture all incidents of legislative violence over approximately the past quarter century there are still more observed incidents in the recent past than in the 1980s and 1990s. There are at least two possible reasons for this:

        - Measurement error: more information is available online for more recent incidents.

        - Democratization: the number of countries with elected legislatures has increased markedly over the observation period. In 1981 there were only 65 countries with elected legislatures in the sample. By 1990 there were 80. By 2012--the last year in the updated sample--there were 149. The shift to democratization actually corresponds to the number of violent incidents observed in the sample. In a new section in the Supplementary Materials [GET PAGE NUMBER] I plot the number of countries with elected multi-party legislatures in the sample per year and compare this to a plot of observed violent incidents per year. We can clearly see that there are on average many fewer incidents of violence in the period prior to about 1995 when there were also relatively few democracies. Raw incidents of violence have increased as the number of countries with elected legislatures has increased. In addition, there are many more new democracies, which as we found in the paper's empirics tend to have more violence.

    In sum, while measurement error may still be a problem despite extensive efforts to find all incidents of legislative violence, the fact that there are more incidents later in the sampling period could largely be the result of there simply being more new democracies.


> 5. I think that the empirics are competent done and I appreciate the extent of the robustness checks. My concern is that there is not enough variation in the dependent variable (especially by limiting the sample to smaller time periods), which is causing some of the “very large, highly unstable, and largely nonsenical coefficient estimates” (page 17). What can the author do to assuage these fears?

    - In addition to the rare events logistic regression method that corrects bias created using a small number of 1's relative to 0's, it is important to note that the "very large, highly unstable, and largely nonsensical coefficient estimates" were only estimated for a small number of variables: political system type and in models with many highly correlated variables. The instability in the coefficient estimates likely has more to do with the high correlations between the covariates (Achen 2002, Schrodt 2006) and, in the case of political system type, lack of variation on the covariate than the violence dependent variable. Political system rarely changes in the sample. The fact that variables that have more variation produce consistently stable coefficients bolsters the case that this is an issue with particular covariates that, while impeding our ability to examine if they affect violence, does not really affect our ability to examine the other, much more theoretically interesting covariates. I have added a note on this to the discussion on page [GET, TO-DO].

    + A related issue: is important to note that I have taken extensive additional steps to ensure that the data set includes all of the incidents of legislative violence in the sampling period. Since submitting the manuscript, I and other research assistants undertook a new effort to verify and update the data set. We have conducted further keyword searches on LexisNexis, NewsLibrary, NewsBank, Google, and Youtube (an excellent source of detailed video evidence of legislative brawls). We did this for both the original submission's time period as well as to the present. As such, I are confident that we have found close to all of the incidents in the sampling period.


> 6. One last nit-picky comment. I like the figures, but the use of jittered dots (rather than confidence intervals or some other alternative) needlessly increases the file size and caused my printer to choke!

    - The plot now uses point ranges/ribbons to show the expected probabilities. This dramatically decreases the file size and increases legibility.

# Reviewer 3

> My first issue with the manuscript comes from the seemingly normative view that violence in the legislature is an indication of poor functioning. . . While I generally agree with the author(s) intuition that we generally do not want violence in these bodies, I would also be careful about attributing that as a sign of good or bad governance. I suspect that we could easily come up with numerous examples where violence was needed to accomplish outcomes. . .  violence in the international system is argued as simply being another type of bargaining behavior and not as some sign of a poorly functioning system. Why could violence at the domestic level be seen in a similar light as simply continuing the bargaining process in a different manner?

    - In many ways I whole heartedly agree with you that a lack of violence does not necessarily indicate that well functioning democratic institutions. No violence in an autocratic legislature, for example, certainly doesn't indicate that the body is a well functioning democratic institution.

    I've tried to highlight in the theory section that legislative violence certainly is a continuation of 'the bargaining process in a different manner'. This is a direct implication of using credible commitment theory to understand legislative violence. [TO-DO] I have also added a discussion to the Conclusion highlighting the point that a lack of violence does not necessarily mean that a legislature is a well-functioning democratic institution.

    Furthermore, the manuscript discusses this possibility in the subsection on the size of the governing majority--a lack of violence in large governing majority legislatures may be both an indication that many legislators are included in the legislative process and can effectively bargain peacefully *or* that the governing majority is so powerful that it can take actions to quash violence before it happens.

    One way that I have tried to empirically avoid conflating dynamics of flagrant non-democratic oppression of legislatures leading to violence and a breakdown of democratic legislative bargaining causing brawls was to subset the sample to include only democracies (i.e. country-years with Polity IV scores > 5). Originally, I included all countries that had elected multi-party legislatures (DPI's LIEC score more than 5). Though there is considerable overlap in the two samples, they are different by about 200 country-years. In general the results were substantively similar.

    Perhaps the one (purely normative) point of disagreement that I have is that, while a lack of violence may not indicate well-functioning democratic institutions, a presence of violence *does* indicate that these institutions are not functioning according to the democratic ideal of enabling peaceful political contestation . I have emphasised this in the text, both in the introduction, and more extensively, in the conclusion

    Attempts to structure political institutions such that bargaining and contestation can be effectively conducted in a peaceful manner is a foundational goal of much of the political science literature in this area.

    In sum, the paper has two purposes:

        + The proximal/empirical purpose: understand the conditions under which legislative bargaining reaches a point where one or more parties feel that violence is a useful tactic.

        + The distal/normative purpose: highlight which of these findings could inform democratic institutional designs such that peaceful bargaining and competition between legislators will be more likely.

> So why among all of the potential frameworks are we to believe that credible commitments are best?  Copious amounts of ink have been spilled talking about violence at the domestic level whether it be civil wars to protests to social movements.  I also suspect that there has been some investigation into pre-election violence among other democratic process related violence (perhaps extra-judicial killings). If they are not best that what are the alternatives that are equally plausible and why are they not utilized?

    - The theoretical framework in this paper was strongly influenced by important recent contributions to understanding pre-election protest and violence primarily the work of Wilkinson, 2006; Beaulieu and Hyde, 2008; Beaulieu, 2014. Protests and violence around elections are probably the most similar substantive area to legislative violence. This work contends that election protests in particular are the result of bargaining breakdowns between governing elites and opposition groups. Factors that this literature proposes as causing bargaining breakdowns include credible commitment problems and misrepresentation of private information. My explanation of legislative violence builds on this directly and makes an important contribution by understanding how legislative institutions affect these problems. I extensively discuss how credible commitment problems can lead to violence, especially in disproportionate legislatures and how democratic age can reveal information about opposing sides ability to credibly commit--i.e. helps ameliorate information asymmetries.

    To stay within the journal's word limits I have added a brief discussion of a recent expressive theory of legislative disruption. [TO-DO] Though the original authors of this theory would likely view it as a competing hypothesis, I would actually argue that it is complementary. Using violence to achieve an expressive goal is more likely when commitments aren't credible.

    In addition, Section 2, does detail a number of alternative approaches to explaining legislative violence, all of which have been informed by the literature--particularly the legislative studies literature--suggested to me in numerous conference presentations and discussions with colleagues. I then try to test these empirically, but have not found support for them. [THINK ABOUT]


> I am not sure the author(s) definition of fair is useful. . . While I understand the intention, the problem is that there are so many unanswered questions that it becomes almost meaningless.  I do not mean that as negatively as it sounds but scholars have been arguing about the definition and meaning of fairness for centuries, so I so not see the utility of framing the paper in that literature (especially without really delving into it). Are they assuming that these conceptions of fairness are constant across time?

    - This has indeed been a tricky issue for this paper through its development. You are correct that regardless of how specifically the term is defined in the paper, many readers bring considerable prior beliefs to their reading of the paper.

    Overall, I feel that it is an issue of framing that can be ameliorated by using a different terminology. To avoid confusion with other and broader conceptualisations of fairness, I have replaced this term with a prediction that credible commitment problems are smaller when: 'seats in the legislature and legislative resources more generally, such as speaking time and committee appointments, proportionally correspond to voters’ support and this correspondence is likely to be maintained in the future'. This is close to the Reviewer's suggestion that "The discussion of disproportional makes more sense and I think is the better way to approach and discuss the theory". More verbose, but hopefully will avoid confusion.

    As such, 'fairness' has been entirely removed from the discussion of democratic age, and largely removed from the proportional electoral outcomes section. It should be noted that I have kept the proposition that legislatures where legislative resources closely correspond to electoral support are less likely to have violence because actors do care about fairness. Though not all actors and not in all times care about fairness to the same extent, the fact that many do is a very well established finding in the game theoretical and related experimental literature. Importantly for this paper's theory it helps explain peaceful equilibria in highly proportional systems. Without the 'fairness equilibria' we would expect to see a cycling of violence as credible commitments would not be possible in proportional systems. As you mention later, beneficiaries of increasing disproportionality in highly proportional systems might use violence to create disproportionate outcomes.

    If this was true then we would expect to see an insignificant proportionality variable--there is no difference in violence between proportional and more disproportional legislatures. However, we do not see this.

    Finally, I certainly do not assume that all actors will always view particular non-zero levels of disproportinality as 'fair'. However, I do believe that it is reasonable to view this issue probabalistically. As outcomes become closer to perfectly proportional more actors at more points in time will be more likely to view the outcomes as fair. [THINK ABOUT]

>   why are we assuming that legislatures are looking at the distribution of legislative resources and not legislative outcomes or even political outcomes?

    - Please see my comments above--in "Joint Concerns".

> Would there not be a more dynamic process that takes into account deviations from expectations and not simply deviations from some pre-defined level?  The author(s) get at this a little with the old versus new democracy argument but it gets tangled up with the discussion of fairness.  I would simply talk about this as a more dynamic process and then the old versus new division seems a lot more intuitive.

    - I have altered the discussion to reflect this. [TO-DO]


> In addition, if these are linked then would there not be an interactive effect?

    - I have added estimates from a model interacting these two variables (page [GET]). None of the terms in the interaction are significant. It is unclear what conclusions we can draw from this finding, especially (as discussed on page [GET]) as it is well-established in the statistical literature that it can be difficult to find meaningful interactions in data sets with relatively small numbers of events. As such, more research is likely needed in the future when longer-time series become available.


> I am not sure what the case study does theoretically or empirically.

    - An important reason (which I have further highlighted in the text [TO-DO]) that the US ante-bellum brawl is theoretically interesting is related to your following question regarding western cultural norms. Though it is difficult to gather information on violence in older legislatures, the case discussed highlights that there are prominent examples of violence in Western democracies when they were younger--as the paper predicts.

    - I certainly agree that one case does not prove the theory, that is exactly why I use the case to illustrate and demonstrate the basic plausibility of the theorised process. The bulk of the evidence for the paper is built on the large-n parametric models. Nonetheless, many readers greatly appreciate illustrative case studies that add plausible 'meat' to statistical 'bones'.

    - Reviewer 2 is very interested in understanding how societal factors may influence factors such as proportionality and democratic age and in turn their influence on brawls. For reasons that I discuss above such, primarily the typical slowness of societal changes, this is very difficult to effectively investigate in the large-n study. Though the case study is by no means a definitive investigation of these complex relationships, it does provide an early glimpse into how they may work.

    As such, following the editor's request I have strengthened the discussion of these reasons for including the case study in the text [TO-DO, GET PAGE]

> Western democracies seem to stick out as the only democracies that do not experience violence.  Is this a cultural norm that has developed and being exported globally?  Obviously this is an empirical question but it is hard to ignore how western democracies stand out.

    - This can be a tricky empirical issue. Western democracies are overwhelmingly older democracies therefore a lack of violence in them is observationally equivalent to to a cultural/normative explanation. However, given the fact that violence did occur in older western democracies, has occurred in newer democracies in the European Union such as Italy, Croatia, and Bulgaria, and there are incidents in sub-national legislatures--e.g. Alabama in 2007--it seems implausible that Western democracies are less violent for some inherent (essentialist) reason.

    Could a non-violence norm have emerged in previously violent western democracies? Certainly, but then the question is why and how? Interestingly, the theory presented in the paper regarding the effect of democratic age on credible commitments provides an answer to this question. What could be thought of as a non-violence norm plausibly was created by learning over time that commitments between legislators are credible.

    This causal story, rather than a simple norm diffusion model, then also explains why the non-violence norm has not easily diffused to new democracies. Though perhaps the presence of such a norm may speed the resolution of credible commitment problems in new democracies, the fact that violence still regularly occurs in new democracies indicates that credible commitment problems remain an issue.  


> is the violence a reaction to the disproportion or is the violence being used to create the disproportion?  The author(s) assume that it is those who do not have their fair share as acting out against it but why should we assume that?  

    - I think the reviewer and I are actually in close agreement on this. As discussed in the theory section, violence may be *both* used by those who wish to have legislative resources more closely align with electoral support *and* by those who wish to preserve imbalances.  

    - One point of disagreement is that in highly proportional systems it does not appear--at least in this sampling period--that parties using violence to increase disproportionality is common. For example, The only case of violence in a highly proportional country--South Africa [FINISH]

> Could the violence be the source of the “unfairness.” In addition, why assume there is only one cause.  Could it not be the case that sometimes it is creating and others the cause in which case the question is when these happen?

    - This is an interesting proposition. Though, I believe that the current analysis actually addresses this issue. The current paper proposes that violence can be used used to maintain disproportionate outcomes. There is another possibility that is examined empirically: violence being used to create disproportionate outcomes in presently more proportional systems. If this was the case then the Lower Disproportionality variable would be statistically insignificant. I.e. their would not be a difference in brawls between proportionate and non-proportionate systems. However, we do not see this.

    This finding lends support to the idea that legislatures are able to achieve 'fairness equilibria'. Otherwise, we would have seen a cycling of violence where commitments are not credible in proportionate or disproportionate legislatures. I have added a discussion of this to the theory section. [TO-DO]


> I think the author(s) need more fine grained data in order to determine who is instigating the violence to answer these questions but they seem critical as only one supports the theoretical argument.

    - Thank you for this suggestion. In fact, colleagues and I are actively deepening the detail of this data set so that we can understand the internal dynamics of specific brawls, including which side (those that would benefit from an increase or decrease in a correspondence between legislative resources and electoral support) 'started' a given brawl. Nonetheless, as you point out and as is discussed in the paper, either side could start a brawl with the ultimate cause being a credible commitment problem.

> 8. Finally, with so many zero cases and an event count, why not use a zero inflated negative binomial model?

    - I examined the possibility of using zero inflated negative binomial regression. This was not in practice possible (using zeroinfl from the R pscl package). There are few country-years with more than 1 brawl (32). Most of these had two brawls, only 6 had 3 brawls. As zero inflated negative binomial regression uses a mixture model, there are likely not enough variation in the count part of the model to estimate it. Furthermore, while I have strong hypotheses regarding whether or not violence will occur (i.e. the logistic part of the mixture model), I don't have any strong priors about why a country would have 2 as opposed to 1 brawl. As such, though this was a helpful possibility to explore zero inflated negative binomial regression appears to neither be estimable for this data or theoretically justified.  [THINK ABOUT]
