## Afghanistan May 8th, 2006

A scuffle last week in which a female deputy (Malalai Joya) was attacked with water bottles and allegedly threatened with a knife shows that Afghanistan has a lot to learn about parliamentary procedure At this, several members of Parliament began hurling water bottles at her, and then rushed her. Several very unflattering terms were thrown at her along with the bottles - amounting to a grave insult in a conservative Muslim society.

## Afghanistan June 6, 2011

A stunned Ms Ahmadzai chucked a bottle back towards Ms Zaki, who then launched herself at Ms Ahmadzai, trying to grab her around the neck and delivering a series of punches to her face as lawmakers gathered for the morning session. Ms Ahmadzai tried to fight back as male MPs rushed in to break up the scrap. MPs were mostly tight-lipped over the embarrassing incident that took place as British Prime Minister David Cameron visited the capital Kabul and held talks with President Hamid Karzai over peace talks with the Taliban.

## Italy October 21st, 1994

An argument between leftist parliament members and ultra-conservative colleagues ended in punches and a scuffle by more than a dozen deputies Thursday.
The melee began when Mauro Paissan of the Greens Party accused members of the conservative governing coalition of sharing the same corrupt philosophy as old-guard politicans disgraced by kickback scandals.
''Today the bribe payers and the bribe takers are you,'' said Paissan, directing his comments toward deputies from the National Alliance, which has roots in a neo-fascist movement.
Several National Alliance members, led by Nicola Pesetto, raced toward Paissan as the Chamber speaker banged her gavel.
One parliament member was slightly injured in the scuffle.

## Italy 1998

LET no one say that Domenico Gramazio is a man lacking in the capacity for self-criticism.
The Italian far-rightwing MP yesterday became perhaps the first European legislator to get involved in a brawl in parliament over football. Gold -braided ushers of the lower house had to restrain him as he tried to storm the government benches and punch Massimo Mauro, an MP of the Democratic Left and a former Juventus player who was chanting "Clown, Clown".
"I ought not to have tried to beat up Massimo Mauro in parliament," he said. "I ought to have tried to beat him up outside."
They take their football seriously in Italy. With the country's membership of the euro about to be decided, and Naples in the throes of a seemingly endless gang war, the parliamentarians decided the issue most worthy of their attention yesterday was whether the referee should have given a penalty to Inter Milan last Saturday for a foul on the team's Brazilian striker, Ronaldo.
